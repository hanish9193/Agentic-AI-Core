"""
The only module allowed to invoke the Playwright CLI directly. Mirrors
LLMService's role for the LLM-calling agents: ExecutionAgent calls this,
never subprocess/npx directly.

What's actually verified here, against a real local Playwright
installation (v1.61.1), not assumed from memory:
- The --reporter=json structure this parses against
- Exit codes (0 if everything passed, non-zero if anything failed)
- --trace=on producing a discoverable attachment in that JSON
- The process-tree-kill fix below, against a real multi-level process
  tree (POSIX) - spawned a child that itself spawned a grandchild, and
  confirmed a naive kill() leaves the grandchild running while killing
  the whole process group correctly reaches it.

What's NOT independently verified: the Windows taskkill /T path (this
sandbox has no Windows environment), and real browser-driven execution
(page.goto, clicking, actual screenshots/video) - needs a real browser
binary, which needs network access to download.

screenshot_path/video_path come from a companion playwright.config.ts
(use: { screenshot, video }) - not simple CLI flags in this Playwright
version, unlike --trace which is. trace_path is the one field of the
three confirmed to populate correctly end to end.

IMPORTANT FAILURE-MODE DESIGN: this class raises PlaywrightRunnerError
only for setup problems that make EVERY future call fail identically
(npx missing) - failing loud and fast there is correct, since nothing
downstream can work either. Anything that goes wrong DURING an actual
run attempt (timeout, a crash mid-execution, unparseable output) returns
a PlaywrightRunResult(status="error", ...) instead of raising. That's a
deliberate choice, not an oversight: if running test case #2 out of 5
blows up, ExecutionAgent's loop needs to keep going for #3, #4, #5
rather than losing all of them because one had a problem. Silently
matches what happens in real Windows use - a single hung browser
shouldn't take down an entire batch's results.
