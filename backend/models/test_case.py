"""
TestCase model.

References its parent Scenario by id, same pattern as Scenario -> Requirement.
Mutable, because `status` moves from PENDING to PASSED/FAILED/BLOCKED once
ExecutionAgent actually runs it, and `evaluation_status`/`confidence` are
written by EvaluationAgent after generation.

`status` and `evaluation_status` are deliberately separate fields, not one
combined one: `status` is about *execution outcome* (did it pass when
actually run through Playwright), `evaluation_status` is about *quality
approval* (was this test case good enough to proceed at all). A test
case can be evaluation-approved and never executed yet, or rejected at
evaluation and therefore never reach execution - conflating them would
make it impossible to represent either state cleanly.

`status` reflects only the most recent execution. Full execution history
(a test case can be run more than once) lives in
WorkflowState.execution_results, matched by test_case_id - this field is
just a convenient at-a-glance summary, not the source of truth.
